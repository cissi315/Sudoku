{- printBoard board
     An IO function that prints a more aesthetically and intuitive pleasing Sudoku board instead of the initial lists within lists layout.
     PRE:  The Sudoku board must be the standard dimensions by 9X9 cells. Empty cells must be represented as int 0.
     SIDE EFFECTS: Prints out the Sudoku in the terminal.
