 {- solve board
     A function that combines multiple functions to solve a Sudoku board using backtracking. 
     PRE:  The Sudoku board must be the standard dimensions by 9X9 cells. Empty cells must be represented as int 0.
     RETURNS: A finished sudoku board or an empty list if it's not possible to solve given Sudoku board.
     EXAMPLES: solve boardEasy == [[5,3,4,8,2,9,7,1,6],[9,6,1,4,5,7,8,2,3],[8,7,2,3,6,1,5,4,9],[2,4,8,9,1,3,6,5,7],
